# Spreadsheet Data Analytics - Assessment 3

Using the Excel file Chapter3Practical to complete the below tasks.

Follow the instructions carefully, and put the answers, etc in the correct cells as directed. All decimal places should be to 2 decimal places unless otherwise stated.

## Question 1

The Excel Worksheet Facebook Survey provides data gathered from a sample of college students. Create a scatter diagram showing the relationship between Hours online/week and Friends.

## Question 2

Create a bubble chart for the first five colleges in the Excel Worksheet Colleges and Universities for which the x-axis is the Top 10% HS, y-axis is Acceptance Rate, and bubbles represent the Expenditures per Student. Hint: you may need to create the chart before selecting the data.

Change the x-Axis so that it goes from 50 to 100. Use data labels to show the *Expenditures per Student* for each bubble.

## Question 3

The Excel Worksheet Internet Usage provides data about users of the Internet. Construct 2 stacked bar charts that will allow you to compare any differences due to age or educational attainment (1 chart for age & 1 for educational attainment) and draw any conclusions that you can. Would another type of chart be more appropriate (put your answer in cell A20)?

## Question 4

Apply three different colours of **data bars** to lunch, dinner, and delivery sales in the Excel Worksheet Restaurant Sales to visualize the relative amounts of sales. Then sort the data in place (hint: use a custom sort) by the day of the week beginning on Sunday. Compare the non-sorted data with the sorted data as to the information content of the visualizations. What observations did you make. Put your answer in cell G3.

## Question 5

For the Excel Worksheet Closing Stock Prices:

1) In cells B24 to E25, apply both column and line spark-lines to visualize the trends in the prices for each of the four stocks in the file.
1) In cell G (G5 to G23), Compute the daily change in the Dow Jones index and apply a win/loss spark-line in cell G24 to visualize the daily up or down movement in the index.

## Question 6

The total runs scored by 30 players in a test cricket match in the year 2011 were recorded to determine which score was the highest and which the lowest. The runs are:

423, 369, 387, 411, 393, 394, 371, 377, 389, 409, 392, 408, 431, 401, 363, 391, 405, 382, 400, 381, 399, 415, 428, 422, 396, 372, 410, 419, 386, 390

Construct the frequency distribution table:

In the worksheet titled Question 6, put the player number in in column A starting from row 2. Put the runs data in column B from row 2 to row 31. Put the sum of all runs in cell B32.

In column C starting at row 2, calculate the relative frequency. Include appropriate headers.

## Question 7

For the Excel Worksheet Purchase Orders:

1. Conduct a Pareto analysis of the Cost per order data. Put the total of Cost per order in cell G98, the percentage column in column L (L4 to L97) and the Cumulative percentage in column M (M4 to M97) to 2 decimal places. Put a header row on row 3.
1. What conclusions can you reach? Put your answer in cell O4.
2 Use Excel’s `CountIf` functions calculate the following:
1. How many orders are for control panels (in cell O7)
1. How many orders are for quantities of less than 500 units (in cell O8)
1. How many orders are for O-Rings with quantities of less than 1100 units (in cell O9)

## Question 8

The Excel Worksheet Q8.Credit Risk Data provides information about bank customers who had applied for loans. The data includes the purpose of the loan, checking and savings account balances, number of months as a customer of the bank, months employed, gender, marital status, age, housing status and number of years at current residence, job type, and credit-risk classification by the bank.

1. Part 1
   1. In column M (M4 to M428), compute the combined checking and savings account balance for each record in the database.
   1. Sort the records by the number of months as a customer of the bank. From examining the data, does it appear that customers with a longer association with the bank have more assets (Enter your answer in cell P1)?
   1. Construct a scatter chart to validate your conclusions.
2. Apply Pareto analysis to draw conclusions about the combined amount of money in checking and savings accounts. Put the 2 additional columns for the pareto in columns N and O. Write your conclusions in cell P2.
3. Use Excel’s CountIf(s) function, extract all records for new-car loans for the 3 different marital status. Put the data in cells P4 to R4 with headers as shown here:

    | Married | Divorced | Single |
    |--------:|---------:|-------:|
    |       8 |       37 |     59 |

4. Construct a clustered column chart to illustrate the results.
5. Construct a pie chart showing the marital status associated with these car loans Put an appropriate Title on the pie chart.
6. Use Excel’s filtering capability to extract all records for individuals employed less than 12 months. Can you draw any conclusions about the credit risk associated with these individuals? Put your conclusions in cell P6.
7. Use PivotTables to construct a cross-tabulation for marital status and housing type in the cell P8.
8. Illustrate the results of the cross tabulation on a PivotChart using a clustered column chart.

## Question 9

A community health-status survey obtained the following demographic information from the respondents:

| Age      | Frequency |
|----------|----------:|
| 18 to 29 |       297 |
| 30 to 45 |       743 |
| 46 to 64 |       602 |
| 65+      |       369 |

Enter the above data in the worksheet titled Question 9 in columns A and B of your worksheet.

Compute the relative frequency and cumulative relative frequency of the age groups in columns C and D of the worksheet (start the data in row 2).

## Question 10

Use the Data Analysis or Excel Histogram tool to develop a frequency distribution and histogram with six bins for the age of individuals in the Excel Worksheet Q10.Credit Risk Data. Include the relative and cumulative relative frequencies on your chart.

Note: You will need to install the add-in as per notes on Moodle (you cannot use excel online you must use the desktop version when using add-ins)

If using the Data Analysis Histogram tool put your table in cell O17.

If using the Excel Histogram Tool put you Number of bins in cell P3, Minimum Age on cell P4, Maximum age in cell P5 , and Bin size in cell P6.

## Question 11

Using the Excel Worksheet Home Market Value  

1. Find the 20th and 80th percentiles of home prices using Excel formulas in cells E4 & E5 (put labels in D4 & D5)
2. Insert the Rank and Percentile using the Data Analysis tool in Excel in cell F3. Compare your calculated 20th & 80th Percentile values to the generated data.

   Note: the data will require 4 columns, so allow the space so that it does not overwrite existing data or calculations.
